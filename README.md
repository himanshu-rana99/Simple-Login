This application allows users to login into a system using their username and password that has been created. If the username and password are a successful match, they will be logged in and will be able to see thier information. Currently, user's credentials and info are being stored in data/users.js file with their hashed and salted passwords instead of plaintext. Users will be notified if they are missing their username or password and if either their username or password are inccorect. The user also has the ability to logout of the system.

This application uses JavaScript to create the routes and handlebars and css for the formatting/styling.
